# Cyber Supply Chain Risk Mapping

This project explores software supply-chain risks arising from
third-party dependencies used in modern applications.

The current focus is on Node.js projects and npm dependencies.
The system is designed to ingest dependency data, analyze
dependency relationships, and model potential risk propagation.

This repository is structured to reflect real-world
supply-chain security tooling.
